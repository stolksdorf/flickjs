In your javascript file you can now access 'flick'

You can add in elements to track flick events on like this:
flick.add([jQuery object], [function to handle the flick]);

the function should have 3 parameters: difference in X, difference in y, and time elasped. Example:

function foo(pageX, pageY, time){
	alert(time +" - " + pageX + " - " + pageY);
}
Check out the demo folder for a demo

flick also has time and distance thresholds. These are used to tell the difference from a click and a flick.
Initally they are set at 80 and 15 respectively. 
I encourage to to experiment with different numbers until they are properly differienting between clicks and flicks on whatever screen you are using.

example:
flick.timeThreshold = 100;
flick.distanceThreshold = 5;

That should be all you need.
